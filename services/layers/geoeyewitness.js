The smell it neither surrenders as it has been in the past, but that&#039;s a constant smell and it&#039;s toxic smelling. It smells like, like it&#039;s a person working on the road or something and you know you smell these chemicals and it&#039;s not so much of a bad smell it&#039;s more of a toxic smell like asphalt and other chemical smells. And it constantly burns my nose and I can&#039;t breathe as well as it takes me some sleeping at night and sometimes I even stop breathing I do. I suffer with sleep apnea but I&#039;m so afraid since I&#039;ve been breathing in this pollution because I&#039;m constantly dizzy and they haven&#039;t found out any reasons why and my fingers are numb all the time and like I said my respiratory system it&#039;s just, it&#039;s just devastated. And I would just like you to know from February the 1st, the end of January today as well as the first has been a low-grade smell but I can still smell it. And again my name is Barbara Green. My number is area code 504-401-439. Thank you.\n\n\n","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Feb 2015 04:07:00 GMT","category":"Odor","id":"14437"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.093663,29.899362]},"properties":{"title":"Sweet Funky Smell in Marrero - made me feel nauseous","link":"http://map.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/14447","description":"Hi.
